# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Setting Up Routes

- `npm i react-router-dom`
- At app.js -> setup `appRouter`  by createBrowserRouter([{
    path: "e.g /"
    element: <ElementToRender/>
    children: [
        if any
    ]
}])
- With the use of <RouterProvider router={appRouter}/>
    so whatver my path will be that element will be rendered.
- where will the children go ?
    - wherever the <Outlet/> will be.



### Higher Order Component

A Higher Order Component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.
HOCs are not part of the React API, but they are a pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature.
A HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

example :
```js
function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Component mounted');
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}```


### Debouncing
Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often,
which can cause performance issues. It limits the rate at which a function can fire.
In the context of web development, debouncing is often used to limit the rate at which a function is executed,
such as handling user input events like keystrokes or window resizing.

```js
useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => handleSearchSuggestion(), 200);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
},[searchQuery]);
```
